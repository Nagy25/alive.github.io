    <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p><strong>Med Interaction</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
        Policy explains how our mobile application collects, uses, and discloses information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. All data entered
        into the app (such as drug selections) is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to any
        external server.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All application data is stored locally on your device using secure local storage methods. You have full control
        over this data and can clear it at any time by uninstalling the application or clearing the app data in your
        device settings.</p>

    <h2>3. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>While we do not collect personal data directly, the app does use third-party services that may collect
        information used to identify you (by your device ID, mostly for advertising and analytics). Link to privacy

        companies may use information suitable for advertising purposes (not including your name, address, email
        address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other apps in order to provide advertisements about
        goods and services of interest to you.</p>
