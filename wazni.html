    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-27</p>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Wazani</strong> (“the App”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App.
        The App is provided by <strong>Smarttech</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have questions, contact us at:
        <a href="mailto:CONTACT_EMAIL">CONTACT_EMAIL</a>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not ask you to create an account</strong> and we do not intentionally collect information that directly identifies you (such as your name, phone number, or address) unless you choose to contact us.</p>

      <h3>1) Information collected automatically</h3>
      <p>When you use the App, some information may be collected automatically, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, OS version, language, country/region)</li>
        <li>App activity (screens viewed, interactions, crash logs)</li>
        <li>Approximate location derived from IP address (for ads and fraud prevention)</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers (such as the device Advertising ID), where available</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2) Information you provide</h3>
      <p>If you contact us (for example by email), we will receive the information you include in your message (such as your email address and the content of your request).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>We may use information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and improve the App</li>
        <li>Show ads and measure ad performance</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent fraud or abuse</li>
        <li>Monitor crashes and fix bugs</li>
        <li>Respond to your support requests</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
      <p>
        The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads. AdMob may collect and use information such as device identifiers,
        IP address, and ad interaction data to deliver and measure ads, including personalized ads where allowed by your settings and local laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can learn more about how Google uses data here:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Partner Sites policy</a>
        and Google’s Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Personalized Ads</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on your region and settings, you may be shown personalized ads. You can control ad personalization from your device settings:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads (or Privacy) → Ad personalization / Reset advertising ID</li>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising (or Tracking settings)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Consent (EEA/UK/Switzerland)</h3>
      <p>
        If required by law, we will request your consent before serving personalized ads.
        You may withdraw consent at any time via the in-app consent options (if available) or your device settings.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Analytics & Crash Reporting</h2>
      <p>
        We may use analytics and crash reporting tools to understand app performance and fix issues.
        These tools may collect device information, app events, and crash logs.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        (If you don’t use analytics or crash reporting, remove this section.)
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>We may share information in the following cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers</strong> (for example, ad networks like AdMob, analytics, crash reporting) to operate and improve the App</li>
        <li><strong>Legal reasons</strong> if required to comply with applicable law or valid legal process</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers</strong> if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep information only as long as needed for the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.
        Logs related to ads, analytics, and crashes may be retained by third-party providers according to their policies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure,
        and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your country),
        and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will take steps to delete it.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        If your app is made for kids, tell me and I’ll rewrite this to match “Designed for Families” / kids requirements and non-personalized ads.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or object to certain processing of your information.

      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>
        The App may contain links to third-party websites/services. We are not responsible for their privacy practices.
        Please review their policies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date above.
        Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy.
